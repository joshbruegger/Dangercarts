# Dangerous Minecarts
If a hunk of iron speeding down some tracks hits you, you'd expect some damage; however, you can stop minecarts going any speed with your body without any repercussions. This is _especially weird_ if you enabled the [Minecart Improvements experiment](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecart_Improvements), in which Minecarts can go super fast.

With this data pack, minecarts now deal damage and knockback based on their speed! If you get killed by one, the death message will appropriately say that you got "smashed by a fast minecart".

Damage and knockback are dealt to all entities that can take it, which has an added bonus of killing or knocking off mobs from your rails, making your minecart not stop as often.

## How does it work?
The data pack works by spawning an invisible slime named "_a fast minecart_" in front of the minecart when it should hit entities. Damage is then applied based on the speed of the Minecart as if it were a mace attack by our favourite invisible slime, _a fast minecart_.

## Credits
This data pack is an adaptation of [Deadly Minecarts](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/deadly-minecarts/) to make it work with versions 1.21.x, and with a few improvements sprinkled in. It also uses a square root function developed by [NOPENAME](https://github.com/NOPENAME).
